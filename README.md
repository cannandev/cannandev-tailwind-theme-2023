Here we go again...

This time we have a pure HTML application with a Tailwind CSS custom theme. This latest site version shows my qualifications as a speaker, instructor, consultant and creator of the Human Centered Engineering series.

## Getting started with a simple http-server

Checkout this repository locally, then:

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
1. Run `npx http-server` to start your local server. Follow [directions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) if you need to install this globally.
1. In another terminal, run `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
`
