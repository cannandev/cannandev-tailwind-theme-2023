Here we go again...

This time we have a pure HTML application with a Tailwind CSS custom theme. This latest site version shows my qualifications as a speaker, instructor, consultant and creator of the Human Centered Engineering series.

## Getting started

Checkout this repository locally, then:

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
1. Run `npm start` to start **http-server**.

To watch and compile CSS changes:
1. In another terminal, run `npx tailwindcss -i src/input.css -o dist/output.css --watch`.
